Sine Wave Prediction with TinyML on STM32

This project showcases a TinyML model deployed on an STM32 microcontroller to predict sine wave patterns. The model is optimized for low-power, real-time inference on embedded devices, demonstrating the feasibility of running machine learning algorithms in resource-constrained environments. The repository contains the STM32 deployment code.
